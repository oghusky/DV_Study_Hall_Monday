# MAKE A PROFILE PAGE
In this session we will be making a simple user profile using, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

We will be using Bootstrap to help format the layout of our profile page.

## Visual Analogy
If we compare web languages to the structure of a house:

### HTML
Hyper-Text Markup Language

HTML is the foundation and structure of your house. It's everything a user can see on your page without any design or interaction.

### CSS
Cascading Style Sheets

CSS is the layout, decor, feng shui of your web page. Color, positioning, font-size, and simple animations can be written here. 

### Javascript

Javascript is comparable to the appliances in your home. Everything a user can interact with is controlled by Javascript.

### For this exercise here are the tools you will need.
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) if you do not already have it.

What we will be building is in the "Solved" folder of this repository.

We will be recreating it in the "Unsolved" folder.
